This is the first line I am inserting into this file.
I hope I can learn Git profitiently.
Third time cloning. Why there was no previous branches
I had created and why this files contents are not showing
when I try to view them in the browser?
The fourth try: last time I used the following procedures:
	>>> git checkout Playground
	>>> added some text
	>>> git checkout master
	>>> git merge Playground master
And it perfectly worked. Now I repeat the previous command
which I typed before it to see if it still works:
	>>> git checkout Playground
	>>> added some text
	>>> git checkout master
	>>> git merge Playground

What the phase? It works... It works... What coud have been
done wrong previous times? I'm gonna check it out again...

Sixth time. I used git add . when being on project's root 
directory. I use git add Playground/playground this time...
although it seems nonsence to me, yet it worth it trying.


Seventh time. The same results and it still has no difference
with the last time or when using: git merge Playground master.
Must had been engaged with some conflictions those times it
was not loading the content correctly in my browser.
