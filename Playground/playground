This is the first line I am inserting into this file.
I hope I can learn Git profitiently.
Third time cloning. Why there was no previous branches
I had created and why this files contents are not showing
when I try to view them in the browser?
The fourth try: last time I used the following procedures:
	>>> git checkout Playground
	>>> added some text
	>>> git checkout master
	>>> git merge Playground master
And it perfectly worked. Now I repeat the previous command
which I typed before it to see if it still works:
	>>> git checkout Playground
	>>> added some text
	>>> git checkout master
	>>> git merge Playground
